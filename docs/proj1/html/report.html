<h2 id="part-1-overall-design">Part 1: Overall Design</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Describe the overall design (mips, inst_memory, &amp; data_memory) with input &amp; output ports interconnected with a diagram. (Refer to <code>microcomputer.vhd</code>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="response">Response:</h3>
<p><code>microcomputer.vhd</code> implements three smaller components within itself. The first component is the data_memory component, this component is responsible for storing all the data in different registers. The second component is inst_memory, this component is responsible for storing the program that CPU is going to execute. The final component is the CPU which currently the CPU only has a 32-bit ALU inside but more will be added as the course progresses. The majority of the work for project 1 was done inside of the CPU we were responsible for creating a 1-bit ALU that implements the following operations: and, or, add, sub, slt. Once the 1-bit ALU was created the file ALU_32.vhd was responsible for concatenating 32 1-bit ALUs to give us a 32-bit ALU. Below is a diagram that shows how all the components are interconnected.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-clock-signal">Part 2: Clock Signal</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain how the clock signal is supplied in the design and how the clock proceeds. (Refer to <code>test_mips.vhd</code>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="response-1">Response:</h3>
<p>The 50MHz clock is supplied to the test_mips.vhd file as an input. There are three different clock options that have been provided for us. The first option is to use key(0) as the clock signal meaning when you press the button the clock progresses. The second option is to slow down the 50MHz clock signal down to a 10MHz clock signal so the CPU would run a little slower. The final option is to use the standard 50MHz clock that is provided with the DE-10 lite board. For project 1 we are utilizing the Key(0) as the clock so every time the button is pushed the program counter is incremented by one address or 4 bytes. We are also able to reset the program counter by pressing key(1) and that will reset the program counter back to 0 so we are able to step through the program again by pressing key(0). The VHDL code checks to make sure both key(0) is pressed and the rising edge of the clock has occurred if both of those are true it increments the program counter by 4 bytes.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-alu-design">Part 3: ALU Design</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain your ALU design. (Refer to <code>alu.vhd</code>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="response-2">Response:</h3>
<p>The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs and, or, add (<code>add</code>), subtract (<code>sub</code>), and set less than (<code>slt</code>) operations on 32-bit words. The ALU can parse MIPS formatted instructions.</p>
<p>The ALU has three inputs: two 32-bit operands, and a 4-bit control signal. All four bits of the control signal are fed to each of the 32 1-bit ALU's. A single bit of each operand is fed to each of the 32 1-bit ALU's.</p>
<p>The zeroth 1-bit ALU requires two unique signal logic statements.</p>
<p>The ALU has three outputs: one 32-bit result, a one-bit overflow indicator, and a one-bit zero indicator. The overflow bit is set when an arithmetic operation returns a result which cannot be expressed with 32-bits. The zero bit is set when the result of an operation is <code>0x00000000</code>. The 32-bit result is collected bit-by-bit from each of the 32 1-bit ALU's.</p>
<p>The 32-bit ALU is constructed by wiring 32 1-bit ALU's in parallel. The and / or operations are implemented using the corresponding logic gates. An adder is used to implement the other three operations. In order to select which output to send as the result, the 1-bit ALU uses a four-to-one multiplexer.</p>
<p>The sum of the 1-bit adder is implemented using a three input exclusive-or gate. The inputs are the two operands and the carry-in bit. The carry-out bit is set when at least two of the three input bits (two operands &amp; carry-in) are one.</p>
<p>The adder can also subtract using two's complement. We obtain the two's complement representation of the negative of the second operand by negating all the bits and setting carry-in bit of the zeroth 1-bit ALU. In order to tell the 1-bit ALU's that the second operand should be negated we include a <code>b_invert</code> signal as a select line to a two-to-one multiplexer connected to the second input of the adder.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-slt-implementation">Part 4: SLT Implementation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain your implementation of <code>slt</code> instruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="response-3">Response:</h3>
<p>The <code>slt</code> instruction is a simple instruction to check if the A input to the ALU is smaller than the B input. To check if A is less than B we must take the two's complement of B then do a subtraction instruction. Once that operation has been completed we can check the most significant bit or in this case the sign bit. If the sign bit is '1' then we know that the result of the subtraction operation was a negative number which tells us that A is less than B. Our current implementation of slt is to perform the subtraction operation on the 31<sup>st</sup> bits of the A input, B input, and the Carry in. If this operation results in a '1' then we know that A is less than B, but if this operation results in a '0' then we know that A is greater than B.</p>
<p>There is another implementation that would involve adding an additional output to every 1-bit ALU. If we added an additional output this would allow us to grab the most significant bit directly from the 31st 1-bit ALU rather than completing a second operation in <code>ALU_32.vhd</code>. We decided against this route because that would involve heavily modifying <code>ALU_32.vhd</code> and we were unaware if we were allowed make these changes.</p>

<p>Explain your ALU control circuit design along with the Boolean expression of each of the four <code>ALUctl</code> signals, as well as the corresponding section of VHDL code (Refer to <code>mips.vhd</code>)</p>

<h2 id="part-6-results">Part 6: Results</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain if your program produces correct ALU output, include a summary of what occurs when <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are swapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="response-5">Response:</h3>
<p>When loaded with our program the board's hex display can show either the address of the instruction being executed by the ALU, or the ALU result in hexadecimal. The hex display can show 6 digits, where each digit represents 4-bits. In our implementation the lower 24 bits are displayed on the hex display and the remaining 8 bits are represented on the row of LEDs.</p>
<p>The two hard-coded operands are <code>A=0x000A 0FF0</code> and <code>B=0x0000 1010</code>. The order of instructions fed to the ALU are <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>slt</code>. The following table summarizes the results obtained with our implementation.</p>

<p>When the order of the operands <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> is reversed our implementation displays the following hex digits on the display. Note that the <code>slt</code> (last row) returns 1 in this case because <code>B</code> is a smaller number than <code>A</code>.</p>
